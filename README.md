Sketch: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a method of improving the visual quality of images captured in weak illumination conditions. In such conditions, the images tend to be noisy, hazy, and have low contrast, making them difficult to distinguish details. LLIE techniques have many practical applications in various fields, including surveillance, astronomy, medical imaging, and consumer photography.

The Android implementations of LLIE methods Opt2Ada and ZeroDce are given in this repository. Here, NCNN is used for optimization and deployment of ZeroDce. Therefore, the NCNN model of ZeroDce and the testing code are also provide.

Here is an output of the tested NCNN ZeroDce model.
